# Snapdex

Snapdex is a multi-framework mobile application that serves as a **Pokédex-style app**, allowing users to take pictures or record sounds of Pokémon in the wild, upload them to a server, and view 3D/AR visualizations. This project is designed to serve both as a **learning experience** and a **professional showcase** of mobile development skills.

## 🚀 Why Snapdex?

### 🎯 Personal Goals
- **Master Mobile Frameworks** – Develop a full-fledged app using **SwiftUI**, **Jetpack Compose / Compose Multiplatform**, and **Flutter** to deepen my understanding of mobile development.
- **Improve Fabulous** – Analyze different architectures and design patterns to refine **Fabulous**.

### 💼 Professional Goals
- **Portfolio Showcase** – Demonstrate expertise in multiple frameworks despite lacking professional experience in them, making it easier for clients and recruiters to evaluate my skills.
- **Industry Reflection & Promotion** – Use insights gained from the project to write blog posts, LinkedIn articles, and engage in discussions on mobile development trends and best practices.
- **Store Deployment** – Ideally, launch the app on **Google Play Store** and **Apple App Store** to demonstrate end-to-end development mastery.
